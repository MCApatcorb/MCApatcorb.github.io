  <h2>An Artsy, Political Poem By Pat</h2>

  <p>What a time to be alive....I guess,</p>
  
  <div id="square-1" role="presentation"></div>
  
  <p>Frick and Frack will try their best,</p>
  
  <div id="square-2" role="presentation"></div>
  
  <p>While we stand back and look,</p>
  
  <div id="square-3" role="presentation"></div>
  
  <p>And wait to oust the mook,</p>
  
  <div id="square-4" role="presentation"></div>
  
  <p>Apparently, you can electrocute the gay away now,</p>
  <p>So go ahead and lower that brow,</p>
  
  <div id="square-5" role="presentation"></div>
  
  <p>There's a majority in the house,</p>
  <p>There's cocaine being smuggled into the country by Mitch Mcconell's family, no seriously, I'll let you google that,</p>
  <p>He's the republican that looks like a turtle if you don't recognize the name,</p>

  <p>That's him â‡§</p>
  
  <p>There's also this guy named Newt Gingrich</p>
  <img src=http://www.frumforum.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Newt4.jpg>
  <p> Recently responded to a female reporter that was interviewing him with, "Well, you're just fascinated by sex" when she asked about Trump saying "Grab her by the pussy"</p>
  <p>When this man ran for president in 2012 he ran on a platform that promised to "colonize the moon by 2020", one of the more pressing issues for the American people,</p>

  <p>That's an actual quote from this motherfucker. I had to look it up to make sure, and he really said that....</p>
  
  <P>And who could forget about Louisiana Rep. Kenny Havard who proposed an extremely important bill,</P>
  <img src=http://img2-3.timeinc.net/people/i/2016/news/160530/kenny-havard-a-435.jpg>
<p>What is this very important bill you ask? Well, it was to force state-wide requirements to be a stripper such as the age cap being 28 years old, and their weight cannot be over 160 lbs. What a great guy. It's about time someone imposed conservative views into the stripper industry. Totally not a waste of time for everyone in that room.</p> 
  
 <p>I could go on. I could continue to list a majority of the Republican party for all the stupid shit they have done or said or are associated with, but all these bleeding-heart liberals are being so horrible about the election results. They're so hateful towards Republicans for no reason! Republicans don't do anything thing to earn this hate. Oh wait, this isn't some dillusional fantasy world. The GOP is just a bunch of assholes that manipulate the bigots of our country to gain power. That's why Trump is our president.</p>

<p>Welcome to a new age in American history. It's Reagon times ten. It's like if Goldwater had won in '64. It's quite the time to be alive. You think the Black Panthers and Weathermen were bad? Who knows what's gonna sprout from this shit water. There is no amount of reefer, and jazz music that will cheer me up.</p>
