<p> Pat is a student at Montserrat College of Art that spends his free time making horrible websites, 
and mediocre cartoons. If this art work offends you that's a good thing. Pat has been working on a series 
centered around the ideologies of the modern GOP platform, and the "alt-right" as the mainstream media has coined them.
