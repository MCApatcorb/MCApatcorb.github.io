<h3>Snippets from other Articles</h3>
<p>

<p>In the early days of web design, beginning in 1995, pixels were not standardized between <abbr title="Personal Computer">PC</abbr> and Macintosh; monitor aspect ratios were not standardized, period; and when we got a <strong>standardized layout language</strong> for the web, every browser supported it differently <em>for years</em>.</p>

<p>Later, when standards were better supported in browsers, some of us pretended that “everybody” had a <code>600 x 400</code> monitor (and then an <code>800 x 600</code>, and then <code>1024 x 768</code>), but these too were consensual hallucinations. And even in those rose-colored fixed-width days, there was always a client or a QA tester whose user preference settings, outdated browser, or wonky operating system blew our carefully constructed fixed-width layouts to hell.</p>

	<h2>My Response:<h2>
</header>

<p>
So after reading Zeldman's article I started to get a better idea of just how frustrating learning code can potentially be.
If someone as skilled as him can truthfully say to this day that coding can still be frustrating at times, and has "never been easy"
then I can only imagine hoe much time it would take to master this sort of thing with the likes of my attention span. Not trying to be discouraging,
just trying to be realistic I suppose. Anyways, after reading the article I got a good idea of just how detailed you have to be about
writing code to get exactly what you want. However, what I took from that was that yes, it certainly can be frustrating, but the
end result can be extremely rewarding as well. Like the example Zeldman gave with the designer Ethan Marcotte. He still had to go into his code
and hand craft it to get exactly what he wanted. There are some short cuts now like "progressive enhancement" and other useful tools, but
Zeldman said himself before all these helpful advancements code was hard, but even with the new tools its still hard. Web design will always be hard if
you are trying to get the specific details you're aiming for since you are coding for the page(s).
